This is the minimum code that seems to be necessary to connect to a
[Minecraft] server version 1.7.2 from [Mojang], but does nothing else
interesting at the moment.

It does everything that is necessary for a successful login:

1. Yggdrasil authentication and token refresh
2. Mojang session requests
3. Session key exchange via RSA
4. AES/CFB8 encryption

Note
====

This is a now just a big pile of mess and meant for personal backup mostly.
