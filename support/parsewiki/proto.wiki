This page presents a dissection of the current stable [http://minecraft.net/game/ Minecraft] protocol. The current pre-release protocol is documented [[Pre-release_protocol|elsewhere]]. The protocol for Pocket Minecraft is substantially different, and is documented at [[Pocket Minecraft Protocol]].

If you're having trouble, check out the [[Protocol_FAQ|FAQ]] or ask for help in the IRC channel ([irc://irc.freenode.net/mcdevs #mcdevs on irc.freenode.net]).

==== Time Update ====

Time is based on ticks, where 20 ticks happen every second. There are 24000 ticks in a day, making Minecraft days exactly 20 minutes long.

The time of day is based on the timestamp modulo 24000. 0 is sunrise, 6000 is noon, 12000 is sunset, and 18000 is midnight.

The default SMP server increments the time by <code>20</code> every second.

==== Spawn Position ====

Sent by the server after login to specify the coordinates of the spawn point (the point at which players spawn at, and which the compass points to). It can be sent at any time to update the point compasses point at.

==== Update Health ====

Sent by the server to update/set the health of the player it is sent to.

Food saturation acts as a food "overcharge". Food values will not decrease while the saturation is over zero. Players logging in automatically get a saturation of 5.0. Eating food increases the saturation as well as the food bar.

|}

==== Respawn ====

To change the player's dimension (overworld/nether/end), send them a respawn packet with the appropriate dimension, followed by prechunks/chunks for the new dimension, and finally a position and look packet.  You do not need to unload chunks, the client will do it automatically.

{{Warning|If the Dimension isn't valid then the client will crash}}

{{Warning|Avoid changing player's dimension to same dimension they were already in, weird bugs can occur i.e. such player will be unable to attack other players in new world (fixes after their death and respawn)}}

==== Player Position And Look ==== 

Updates the players position on the server. 
If the distance between the last known position of the player on the server and the new position set by this packet is greater than 100 units will result in the client being kicked for "You moved too quickly :( (Hacking?)"
Also if the fixed-point number of X or Z is set greater than <code>3.2E7D</code> the client will be kicked for "Illegal position"

Yaw is measured in degrees, and does not follow classical trigonometry rules. The unit circle of yaw on the XZ-plane starts at (0, 1) and turns counterclockwise, with 90 at (-1, 0), 180 at (0,-1) and 270 at (1, 0). Additionally, yaw is not clamped to between 0 and 360 degrees; any number is valid, including negative numbers and numbers greater than 360.

Pitch is measured in degrees, where 0 is looking straight ahead, -90 is looking straight up, and 90 is looking straight down.

The yaw of player (in degrees), standing at point (x0,z0) and looking towards point (x,z) one can be calculated with:
  l = x-x0
  w = z-z0
  c = sqrt( l*l + w+w )
  alpha1 = -arcsin(l/c)/PI*180
  alpha2 =  arccos(w/c)/PI*180
  if alpha2 > 90 then
    yaw = 180 - alpha1
  else
    yaw = alpha1

You can get a unit vector from a given yaw/pitch via:
  x = -cos(pitch) * sin(yaw)
  y = -sin(pitch)
  z =  cos(pitch) * cos(yaw)

==== Spawn Player ====

This packet is sent by the server when a player comes into visible range, '''not''' when a player joins.

Servers can, however, safely spawn player entities for players not in visible range. The client appears to handle it correctly.

|}
{{Warning|The client will crash if no metadata is sent}}
{{Warning|The client will disconnect if both UUID and Name are empty}}

==== Collect Item ====

Sent by the server when someone picks up an item lying on the ground - its sole purpose appears to be the animation of the item flying towards you. It doesn't destroy the entity in the client memory, and it doesn't add it to your inventory. The server only checks for items to be picked up after each Player Position and [Player Position & Look packet sent by the client.

|}

==== Entity ====

Most entity-related packets are subclasses of this packet. When sent from the server to the client, it may initialize the entry.

For player entities, either this packet or any move/look packet is sent every game tick.
So the meaning of this packet is basically that the entity did not move/look since the last such packet.

{| class="wikitable"
! Packet ID !! Field Name !! Field Type !! Notes
|-
| rowspan=1 | 0x14
| Entity ID || Int || Entity's ID
|}

==== Entity Relative Move ====

This packet is sent by the server when an entity moves less then 4 blocks; if an entity moves more than 4 blocks Entity Teleport should be sent instead.

This packet allows at most four blocks movement in any direction, because byte range is from -128 to 127.

{| class="wikitable"

|-
| rowspan=4| 0x15

|-
| DZ || Byte || Change in Z position as a [[Data_Types#Fixed-point_numbers|Fixed-Point number]]
|}

==== Entity Look ====

This packet is sent by the server when an entity rotates.  Example: "Yaw" field 64 means a 90 degree turn.

{| class="wikitable"
! Packet ID !! Field Name !! Field Type !! Notes
|-
| rowspan=3 | 0x16
| Entity ID || Int || Entity's ID
|-
| Yaw || Byte || The X Axis rotation as a fraction of 360
|-
| Pitch || Byte || The Y Axis rotation as a fraction of 360
|}

==== Entity Look and Relative Move ====

This packet is sent by the server when an entity rotates and moves.
Since a byte range is limited from -128 to 127, and movement is offset of fixed-point numbers,
this packet allows at most four blocks movement in any direction. (-128/32 == -4)

==== Chunk Data ====

Chunks are not unloaded by the client automatically. To unload chunks, send this packet with ground-up continuous=true and no 16^3 chunks (eg. primary bit mask=0). The server does not send skylight information for nether-chunks, it's up to the client to know if the player is currently in the nether. You can also infer this information from the primary bitmask and the amount of uncompressed bytes sent.

You can also set an animation to air! The animation will still be visible.

If you need to display several break animations at the same time you have to give each of them a unique Entity ID.

Also if you set the coordinates to a special block like water etc. it won't show the actual break animation but some other interesting effects. (Water will loose it's transparency)

==== Effect ====

Sent when a client is to play a sound or particle effect.

By default, the minecraft client adjusts the volume of sound effects based on distance. The final boolean field is used to disable this, and instead the effect is played from 2 blocks away in the correct direction. Currently this is only used for effect 1013 (mob.wither.spawn), and is ignored for any other value by the client.

! Packet ID !! Field Name !! Field Type !! Notes
|-
| 0x40
| Reason || String || Displayed to the client when the connection terminates. Must be valid JSON.

=== Serverbound ===

==== Keep Alive ====

The server will frequently send out a keep-alive, each containing a random ID. The client must respond with the same packet.

{| class="wikitable"
! Packet ID !! Field Name !! Field Type !! Notes
|-
| rowspan=1 | 0x00
| Keep Alive ID || Int ||
|}

==== Chat Message ==== 

The default server will check the message to see if it begins with a '/'. If it doesn't, the username of the sender is prepended and sent to all other clients (including the original sender). If it does, the server assumes it to be a command and attempts to process it. A message longer than 100 characters will cause the server to kick the client. This change was initially done by allowing the client to not slice the message up to 119 (the previous limit), without changes to the server. For this reason, the vanilla server kept the code to cut messages at 119, but this isn't a protocol limitation and can be ignored.

For more information, see [[Chat]].

|-
| rowspan=1 | 0x01
| Message || String || 
|}

==== Use Entity ====

This packet is sent from the client to the server when the client attacks or right-clicks another entity (a player, minecart, etc).

A Notchian server only accepts this packet if the entity being attacked/used is visible without obstruction and within a 4-unit radius of the player's position.

Note that middle-click in creative mode is interpreted by the client and sent as a Creative Inventory Action packet instead.

{| class="wikitable"
! Packet ID !! Field Name !! Field Type !! Notes
|-
| rowspan=2 | 0x02
| Target || Int ||
|-
| Mouse || Byte || 0 = Left-click, 1 = Right-click
|}

==== Player ====

This packet is used to indicate whether the player is on ground (walking/swimming), or airborne (jumping/falling).

When dropping from sufficient height, fall damage is applied when this state goes from False to True. The amount of damage applied is based on the point where it last changed from True to False. Note that there are several movement related packets containing this state.

{| class="wikitable"
! Packet ID !! Field Name !! Field Type !! Notes
|-
| rowspan=1 | 0x03
| On Ground || Bool || True if the client is on the ground, False otherwise
|}

==== Player Position ==== 

Updates the players XYZ position on the server. 
If <code>Stance - Y</code> is less than <code>0.1</code> or greater than <code>1.65</code>, the stance is illegal and the client will be kicked with the message “Illegal Stance”.
If the distance between the last known position of the player on the server and the new position set by this packet is greater than 100 units will result in the client being kicked for "You moved too quickly :( (Hacking?)"
Also if the fixed-point number of X or Z is set greater than <code>3.2E7D</code> the client will be kicked for "Illegal position"

==== Player Look ==== 

[[File:Minecraft-trig-yaw.png|thumb|The unit circle for yaw]]

[[File:Yaw.png|thumb|The unit circle of yaw, redrawn]]

Updates the direction the player is looking in.

Yaw is measured in degrees, and does not follow classical trigonometry rules. The unit circle of yaw on the XZ-plane starts at (0, 1) and turns counterclockwise, with 90 at (-1, 0), 180 at (0,-1) and 270 at (1, 0). Additionally, yaw is not clamped to between 0 and 360 degrees; any number is valid, including negative numbers and numbers greater than 360.

Pitch is measured in degrees, where 0 is looking straight ahead, -90 is looking straight up, and 90 is looking straight down.

The yaw of player (in degrees), standing at point (x0,z0) and looking towards point (x,z) one can be calculated with:
  l = x-x0
  w = z-z0
  c = sqrt( l*l + w+w )
  alpha1 = -arcsin(l/c)/PI*180
  alpha2 =  arccos(w/c)/PI*180
  if alpha2 > 90 then
    yaw = 180 - alpha1
  else
    yaw = alpha1

Pitch is measured in degrees, where 0 is looking straight ahead, -90 is looking straight up, and 90 is looking straight down.

You can get a unit vector from a given yaw/pitch via:
  x = -cos(pitch) * sin(yaw)
  y = -sin(pitch)
  z =  cos(pitch) * cos(yaw)

| Z || Int || Block position
|-
| Face || Byte || The face being hit (see below)
|}

Status can (currently) be one of six values:

{| class="wikitable"
! Meaning !! Value
|-
| Started digging || <code>0</code>
|-
| Cancelled digging || <code>1</code>
|-
| Finished digging || <code>2</code>
|-
| Drop item stack || <code>3</code>
|-
| Drop item || <code>4</code>
|-
| Shoot arrow / finish eating || <code>5</code>
|}

Notchian clients send a 0 (started digging) when they start digging and a 2 (finished digging) once they think they are finished. If digging is aborted, the client simply send a 1 (Cancel digging).

Status code 4 (drop item) is a special case.  In-game, when you use the Drop Item command (keypress 'q'), a dig packet with a status of 4, and all other values set to 0, is sent from client to server. Status code 3 is similar, but drops the entire stack.

Status code 5 (shoot arrow / finish eating) is also a special case. The x, y and z fields are all set to 0 like above, with the exception of the face field, which is set to 255.

The face can be one of six values, representing the face being hit:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Value || 0 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5
|-
| Offset || -Y || +Y || -Z || +Z || -X || +X
|}

In 1.7.3, when a player opens a door with left click the server receives Packet 0xE+start digging and opens the door.

==== Player Block Placement ====
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Packet ID !! Field Name !! Field Type !! Notes
|-
| rowspan="8" | 0x08
| X || Int || Block position
|-
| Y || Unsigned Byte || Block position
|-
| Z || Int || Block position
|-
| Direction || Byte || The offset to use for block/item placement (see below)
|-
| Held item || [[Slot_Data|Slot]] ||
|-
| Cursor position X || Byte || The position of the crosshair on the block
|-
| Cursor position Y || Byte ||
|-
| Cursor position Z || Byte ||
|}
In normal operation (ie placing a block), this packet is sent once, with the values set normally.

This packet has a special case where X, Y, Z, and Direction are all -1. (Note that Y is unsigned so set to 255.) This special packet indicates that the currently held item for the player should have its state updated such as eating food, shooting bows, using buckets, etc.

In a Notchian Beta client, the block or item ID corresponds to whatever the client is currently holding, and the client sends one of these packets any time a right-click is issued on a surface, so no assumptions can be made about the safety of the ID.  However, with the implementation of server-side inventory, a Notchian server seems to ignore the item ID, instead operating on server-side inventory information and holding selection. The client has been observed (1.2.5 and 1.3.2) to send both real item IDs and -1 in a single session.

Special note on using buckets:  When using buckets, the Notchian client might send two packets:  first a normal and then a special case.  The first normal packet is sent when you're looking at a block (e.g. the water you want to scoop up).  This normal packet does not appear to do anything with a Notchian server.  The second, special case packet appears to perform the action - based on current position/orientation and with a distance check - it appears that buckets can only be used within a radius of 6 units.

Sent when the player changes the slot selection

{| class="wikitable"
! Packet ID !! Field Name !! Field Type !! Notes

|-
| Jump || Bool ||
|-
| Unmount || Bool || True when leaving the vehicle

==== Close Window ====

This packet is sent by the client when closing a window. 

Note, notchian clients send a close window message with window id 0 to close their inventory even though there is never an Open Window message for inventory. 

{| class="wikitable"
! Packet ID !! Field Name !! Field Type !! Notes
|-
| 0x0D
| Window id || byte || This is the id of the window that was closed. 0 for inventory.
|}


==== Click Window ====

This packet is sent by the player when it clicks on a slot in a window.

{| class="wikitable"
! Packet ID !! Field Name !! Field Type !! Notes
|-
| rowspan="6" | 0x0E
| Window ID || Byte || The id of the window which was clicked. 0 for player inventory.
|-
| Slot || Short || The clicked slot. See below.

|-
| Mode || Byte || Inventory operation mode. See below.
|-
| Clicked item || [[Slot_Data|Slot]] ||
|}

See [[Inventory#Windows|inventory windows]] for further information about how slots are indexed.

When right-clicking on a stack of items, half the stack will be picked up and half left in the slot.  If the stack is an odd number, the half left in the slot will be smaller of the amounts.

The Action number is actually a counter, starting at 1.  This number is used by the server as a transaction ID to send back a [[#0x6A|Transaction packet]].

The distinct type of click performed by the client is determined by the combination of the "Mode" and "Button" fields.
{| class="wikitable"
! Mode !! Button !! Slot !! Trigger
|-
! rowspan="2" | 0
| 0 || Normal || Left mouse click
|-

|}

Starting from version 1.5, "painting mode" is available for use in inventory windows. It is done by picking up stack of something (more than 1 items), then holding mouse button (left, right or middle) and dragging holded stack over empty (or same type in case of right button ) slots. In that case client sends the following to server after mouse button release (omitting first pickup packet which is sent as usual):

# packet with mode 5, slot -999 , button (0 for left | 4 for right);
# packet for every slot painted on, mode is still 5, button (1 | 5);
# packet with mode 5, slot -999, button (2 | 6);

If any of the painting packets other than the "progress" ones are sent out of order (for example, a start, some slots, then another start; or a left-click in the middle) the painting status will be reset.

==== Player Abilities ====

The latter 2 bytes are used to indicate the walking and flying speeds respectively, while the first byte is used to determine the value of 4 booleans.
 
The flags are whether damage is disabled (god mode, 8, bit 3), whether the player can fly (4, bit 2), whether the player is flying (2, bit 1), and whether the player is in creative mode (1, bit 0).
 
To get the values of these booleans, simply AND (&) the byte with 1,2,4 and 8 respectively, to get the 0 or 1 bitwise value. To set them OR (|) them with their repspective masks.
The vanilla client sends this packet when the player starts/stops flying with the second parameter changed accordingly. All other parameters are ignored by the vanilla server.

== Status ==
The status ping works as follows. 
    C->S : Handshake State=1
    C->S : Request
    S->C : Response
    C->S : Ping
    S->C : Ping

=== Clientbound ===

== Login ==

The login process is as follows:
    C->S : Handshake State=2
    C->S : Login Start
    S->C : Encryption Key Request
    (Client Auth)
    C->S : Encryption Key Response
    (Server Auth, Both enable encryption)
    S->C : Login Success

For unauthenticated and* localhost connections there is no encryption.
In that case Login Start is directly followed by Login Success.

<nowiki>*</nowiki> It could be that only one of the two conditions is enough for an unencrypted connection.
